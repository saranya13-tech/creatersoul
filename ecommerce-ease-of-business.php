                                <p>For centuries, the process of buying and selling remained as Customers visiting
                                    businesses in-person to make purchases or to sell, and companies kept all of their
                                    stock stored locally. However, the advent of the internet drastically changed retail
                                    for both consumers and business owners. The entire buying scenario changed
                                    drastically as 70 percent of consumers who want to buy a product browse online
                                    before making an in-store purchase. It also affected the shopper's and business's
                                    way of interacting with the customer. Time has arrived as more and more purchases
                                    are made through online platforms even without visiting a physical storefront.</p>
                                <h3>Why Small Business Need E-commerce</h3>
                                <p>Business for centuries for all the companies or all the brand went high by making the
                                    availability of their respective products available for the customer in the most
                                    convenient manner. As if a customer visits a store in person, the interaction
                                    between the people decides the goods can be sold or not. A good salesperson can
                                    interact adversely to make the product sold. As technology seems a surge, the
                                    Internet becomes an essential part of life for the people and the company or brands.
                                </p>
                                <p>Here, E-commerce acts as a bridge between B2B, B2C, C2B, C2C, network marketing, and
                                    several other business plans for your store. Internet search engines became the
                                    powerhouse of marketing. Even when customers do visit a store in person, it’s
                                    usually after completing research online first. It will be difficult for stores with
                                    no online presence to keep up, with online retailers offering deep discounts, fast
                                    shipping, and cost comparisons. It has become critically important for small
                                    businesses to build a strong online marketing and e-commerce strategy.</p>
